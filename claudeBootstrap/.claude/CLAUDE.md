# Prisme.ai Environment

## Environment Configuration

| Environment | Aliases | Default Workspace |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `sandbox` | sb | ai-knowledge |
| `prod` | production | - |

**Default behavior**: Search on `ai-knowledge` workspace in `sandbox` environment unless specified otherwise.

### Workspace Parameter Rules

Use the correct parameter based on user input:

| User provides | Use parameter | Example |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Raw ID (e.g., `e-sdfwe`) | `workspaceId` | `workspaceId: "e-sdfwe"` |
| Named alias (e.g., `ai-knowledge`) | `workspaceName` | `workspaceName: "ai-knowledge"` |

Known workspace aliases: `ai-knowledge` (AIK), `ai-store` (AIS). Any other workspace has no "workspaceName" to provide to tools.

### Local Workspace Priority

**IMPORTANT**: The local codebase contains Prisme.ai workspace folders. **ALWAYS search locally first** using `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` tools before calling any remote APIs.

1. Each folder in `./` is a Prisme.ai workspace with automations, pages, and config
2. Read local YAML files directly - they represent the current working state
3. Check local folders before using `search_workspaces` - if the workspace exists locally, use its `index.yml` to get the ID
4. Only call `list_automations`, `get_automation`, `search_workspaces`, or other remote APIs if explicitly needed for remote-only data (e.g., events, execution) or if the workspace is not found locally

This avoids unnecessary API calls and ensures you work with the latest local changes.

**Workspace ID from local files**: The `index.yml` file in each local workspace folder contains the `id` field with the workspace ID. Use this ID with the `workspaceId` parameter when calling Prisme.ai MCP tools (e.g., `search_events`, `execute_automation`).

## Tool Usage Guide

### When to Use Each Tool

| Tool | Use When |
|------|----------|
| `search_events` | User mentions: correlationId, activity feed, events, execution history, logs, tracing, debugging, errors/failures |
| `get_automation` | Need to inspect a specific automation's YAML |
| `list_automations` | Need to see all automations in a workspace |
| `get_prisme_documentation` | Need Prisme.ai syntax, patterns, or feature reference |
| `lint_doc` | Need to validate automation YAML for common mistakes |
| `get_app` / `list_apps` | Working with apps from the marketplace |
| `pull_workspace` / `push_workspace` | Syncing workspace DSUL locally (workspace folders are now DSUL-pure — React apps live in the sibling `pages/<workspace>/`, see rule below) |
| `execute_automation` | Testing an automation with a payload |

### React apps live in `pages/<workspace>/`, OUTSIDE `workspaces/` (moved 2026-06-25)

A workspace's React app (starter-spa pattern) now lives in **`pages/<workspace>/`**,
a sibling of `workspaces/` at the repo root, **named after the workspace**. The
workspace folder (`workspaces/<workspace>/`) is **DSUL-pure** — it no longer contains
any `pages/<name>/` React subfolder (only legacy DSUL pages `*.yml` may remain there).

```
prismeai-workspaces/
├── workspaces/<workspace>/   ← DSUL only (index.yml, automations/, imports/, security.yml)
└── pages/<workspace>/        ← React app (src/, scripts/, package.json, dist/, node_modules/)
```

This layout **eliminates the old data-loss risk**: `push_workspace workspaces/<ws>`
no longer sees any React subfolder, so it can't ship `node_modules` (importer 500) or
clobber the remote canonical sources (Studio page vanishing). Still true: `push_workspace`
does **not** update runtime `config.value`, so it can't deploy the bundle pointer
(`config.value.bundles[*].bundle` / `config.block`).

**Rules:**
- `push_workspace` targets `workspaces/<ws>` (DSUL). It never touches `pages/<ws>`.
- To deploy a workspace's React app / SPA bundle, use the **`/workspace-page-implement`**
  skill (builds the CJS bundle, uploads it, PATCHes `config.value`+`config.block`,
  `publish_app`) — never `upload_file` + manual config edits or raw MCP for the bundle.
- App ↔ DSUL are linked by **identical name**: `pages/<ws>` ↔ `workspaces/<ws>`.

### Event Search Patterns

Common Elasticsearch DSL patterns for `search_events`:

```json
{"bool": {"filter": [{"term": {"source.correlationId": "uuid-here"}}]}}
```

```json
{"bool": {"filter": [{"term": {"type": "runtime.automations.executed"}}]}}
```

```json
{"bool": {"filter": [{"term": {"source.automationSlug": "automation-name"}}]}}
```

```json
{"bool": {"filter": [{"term": {"type": "error"}}]}}
```

**Sorting**: Always use `@timestamp` (not `timestamp`) for time-based sorting.

## Products Quick Reference

| Product | Nickname | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| AI Knowledge | AIK | RAG, knowledge bases, LLM middleware |
| AI Store | AIS | Chat interface, agent marketplace |
| Builder | - | Custom workflows, automations, pages |
| SecureChat | - | Enterprise conversational interface |
| Collection | - | Tabular data with AI querying |
| Governance | - | Platform admin, RBAC |
| Insights | - | Conversation analytics |

### AI Knowledge Query Flow

Entry point is `genericQuery`, which orchestrates:
1. Config phase: rate limits, model specs, attachments
2. Prompt building: system prompt, history, context
3. Tool loop: `callLLMWithTools` handles tool calling
4. Post-processing: suggestions, source filtering

Key automations: `query`, `genericQuery`, `buildPrompt`, `LLMCompletion`, `callLLMWithTools`, `executeTool`

### AI Store Architecture

- Each "agent" in AI Store = AI Knowledge project
- Uses `Knowledge Client` app to interface with AIK
- Conversations stored via `Conversations Service App`
- SSE streaming for real-time responses

### Agent URLs

URLs to access agents in the Prisme.ai interface follow this pattern:

```
https://{environment}.prisme.ai/fr/product/ai-knowledge/documents?id={projectId}
```

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| sandbox | `https://sandbox.prisme.ai` |
| prod | `https://prisme.ai` |

**Finding the project ID**: The `id` parameter is found in the workspace's `imports/Knowledge Client.yml` file.

**Usage**: When working on a workspace with a Knowledge Client, provide the full clickable URL to the user so they can easily test the agent in their browser.

## Event Schema Quick Reference

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `type` | Event category (e.g., `runtime.automations.executed`, `error`) |
| `source.correlationId` | Groups related events from same operation |
| `source.automationSlug` | Automation name |
| `source.workspaceId` | Workspace identifier |
| `source.userId` | User who triggered event |
| `payload` | Event-specific data |
| `@timestamp` | Event timestamp (use for sorting) |

Common event types:
- `runtime.automations.executed` - Automation completed
- `runtime.fetch.failed` - HTTP request failed
- `error` - Generic error
- `workspaces.automations.updated` - Automation changed

**After creating or editing YAML/DSUL automations**, always run `validate_automation` to check for syntax and semantic errors.

**IMPORTANT**: `validate_automation` is authoritative for DSUL validation—trust it over existing workspace patterns (which may contain legacy mistakes). If validation conflicts with documentation, list issues and report to human before fixing.

## Response Guidelines

- Keep answers concise and relevant
- Use available tools iteratively until you find the answer
- When debugging, trace events using `correlationId`
- Reference specific automation slugs and line numbers when helpful
- If blocked, explain what information would help resolve the issue

## Isolate workspace dev in a worktree

When the user starts a development task on a workspace (any request to implement,
edit, or build a feature/fix on a workspace — i.e. before writing or changing any
DSUL/automation/page), **spontaneously propose, as the first thing, to do the
implementation in a dedicated git worktree on a new branch.**

- Make this a short one-line offer, e.g. *"Je crée un worktree + branche `workspace/<slug>-<short-desc>` pour isoler ce dev ?"* — derive the branch name from the workspace slug and a short kebab-case description of the task.
- If the user accepts, create the worktree (use the worktree isolation mechanism), branch from `sandbox`, and do all edits there.
- If the user declines or says to proceed in place, work in the current directory without asking again for that task.
- Skip the offer for pure read-only work (diagnostics, event tracing, questions) — it only applies when actual file changes are coming.

## Development steps to edit workspace

- Check if there is a local version of the workspace in ./
- Read the documentation of the relevant products, automations, before anything
- Edit the automations in local
- Once completed read the lint_doc to check for common mistakes
- Execute a sub-task to review the code changed and give a list of eventual issues rated MAJOR | NEED_HUMAN Format using emoji in bulleted-list.
