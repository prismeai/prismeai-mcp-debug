# Prisme.ai Workspace Configuration

Workspace settings, security, events, and versioning.

---

## Secrets

AES-256 encrypted. Access via `{{secret.apiKey}}`. Cannot be read from automations, only used. `prismeai_*` reserved for super admins.

```yaml
# Workspace config
config:
  value:
    headers:
      apiKey: '{{secret.apiKey}}'

# Repository config
repositories:
  github:
    config:
      auth:
        password: '{{secret.gitPassword}}'

# Automations
- fetch:
    url: https://api.example.com
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer {{secret.apiToken}}
```

## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

```yaml
authorizations:
  roles:
    editor: {}
    user:
      auth:
        prismeai: {}
    admin:
      auth:
        prismeai:
          conditions:
            authData.email:
              $regex: ^.*@mycompany.com$
    workspace:
      auth:
        apiKey: {}

  rules:
    # Public (no role = everyone)
    - action: read
      subject: pages
      conditions:
        labels:
          $in:
            - public

    # Role-based
    - role: user
      action: read
      subject: pages

    - role: editor
      action:
        - read
        - update
      subject: pages

    - role: editor
      action: manage
      subject: files

    # Deny (inverted)
    - role: editor
      inverted: true
      action: read
      subject: events
      conditions:
        type:
          $regex: ^apikeys\.*$

    # Event permissions
    - action: create
      subject: events
      conditions:
        source.serviceTopic: topic:runtime:emit

    # API key
    - role: workspace
      action:
        - read
        - aggregate_search
      subject:
        - workspaces
        - events
```

### Subjects & Actions

when:
  events:
    - initAdmin

# In RBAC rules
- role: admin

      $in:
        - admin
```

### Workspace API Keys
```yaml

## One-Product IAM

Workspace `security.yml` RBAC controls workspace-level access and DSUL permissions. One-product organization IAM is managed separately by AI Governance v2 and native API Gateway `/v2` endpoints.

Use AI Governance v2 for:

- Org membership, roles, groups, invites, and active org context.
- API keys with product permission scopes such as `agent-factory:agents:*`, `storage:vector_stores:*`, and `llm-gateway:models:*`.
- Service accounts and short-lived workspace-to-workspace JWTs.
- Observability, audit search, announcements, and cross-workspace membership helpers.

Use workspace config and imports for local app configuration, secrets, and DSUL app instances.

## App Imports

Apps are installed via YAML files in the `imports/` folder. Each file defines one app instance with its configuration.

### File Structure

```
workspace/
├── imports/
│   ├── MyCollection.yml
│   ├── Storage Client.yml
│   └── Custom Code.yml
├── automations/
├── pages/
└── index.yml
```

### Import Format

```yaml
appSlug: <AppSlugFromMarketplace>   # App name in the App Marketplace (case-sensitive)
slug: <InstanceName>          # Name referenced by automations in this workspace
config:                       # App-specific configuration
  # ... config fields based on app's configSchema
```

### Example: Collection App

```yaml
appSlug: Collection
slug: Messages
config:
  collectionName: Messages
  indexes:
    - properties:
        - conversationId
        - createdAt
  uniques:
    - properties: conversationId
  properties:
    conversationId:
      type: text
      nullable: false
    content:
      type: text
    from:
      type: json
      nullable: false
    createdAt:
      type: datetime
      nullable: false
```

### Collection App Config Schema

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `collectionName` | string | Internal collection name |
| `properties` | object | Column definitions with `type` and `nullable` |
| `indexes` | array | Fields to index for query performance |
| `uniques` | array | Fields with unique constraints |

**Property types:** `string`, `text`, `date`, `time`, `datetime`, `number`, `double`, `float`, `integer`, `decimal`, `boolean`, `uint8array`, `array`, `enum`, `enumArray`, `json`, `blob`

### Accessing Imported App Config

From automations, access imported app configuration:
```yaml
{{$workspace.imports.Messages.config}}
{{$workspace.imports.Messages.config.collectionName}}
```

### Calling App Automations

```yaml
# Pattern: <slug>.<automation>:
- Messages.find:
    query:
      conversationId: "{{conversationId}}"
    output: messages

- Messages.insert:
    data:
      conversationId: "{{conversationId}}"
      content: "{{content}}"
      createdAt: '{% {{run.date}} %}'
```

### Getting App Config Schema

To find an app's available config options, use the `get_app` MCP tool:
```
mcp__prisme-ai-builder__get_app(appSlug: "Collection")
```

The response includes `configSchema` with all available configuration fields.

## Event Mapping (aggPayload)

```yaml
events:
  types:
    usage:
      schema:
        usage:
          type: object
          properties:
            total_tokens:
              type: number
            cost:
              type: number
              format: double
```

Query with `aggPayload.*` for aggregations.

          YOUR SSH KEY
```
