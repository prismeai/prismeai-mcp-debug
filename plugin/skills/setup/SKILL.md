# Prisme.ai MCP Setup

Use this skill when a Prisme.ai MCP tool reports that an environment is unknown, no token is registered, or a stored token was rejected.

## Rules

- Do not ask the user to paste an API token into the chat unless they explicitly choose that fallback after being warned that the token will be sent to the LLM provider.
- Do not try another environment when the user specified one. The requested environment must be configured before retrying.
- For a new environment, ask the user for the studio URL or API URL if it is not obvious.
- Use the out-of-band `set-token` CLI as the default setup path.

## Environment URLs

Common mappings:

| Studio URL | API URL |
|------------|---------|
| `https://sandbox.prisme.ai` | `https://api.sandbox.prisme.ai/v2` |
| `https://staging.prisme.ai` | `https://api.staging.prisme.ai/v2` |
| `https://studio.prisme.ai` | `https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2` |

For other deployments, derive the API URL from the user's Prisme.ai host or ask the user to confirm it.

## Setup Flow

1. Identify the target environment name from the failed request or user request.
2. Tell the user to create a token in the target studio at:

   ```text
   <studio-url>/settings/tokens
   ```

3. Tell the user to run the exact CLI command from the MCP error in their own terminal. Preserve it as one shell command; do not insert line breaks inside quoted paths. The CLI prompts for the token, then the Prisme API URL. Give `https://api.sandbox.prisme.ai/v2` as an example, and tell the user they can copy the API base URL from the browser Network tab if unsure.

   For a known environment:

   ```bash
   node "<plugin>/build/index.js" set-token <environment> --config-dir "<config-dir>"
   ```

   For an unknown environment:

   ```bash
   node "<plugin>/build/index.js" set-token <environment> --api-url <api-url> --config-dir "<config-dir>"
   ```

4. After the command succeeds, retry the original MCP tool call with the same explicit environment.

## Fallback

Only if the user explicitly wants to paste the token in chat, warn them first:

```text
Using set_token means the token is sent through this conversation to the LLM provider. The CLI path keeps it local.
```

Then call `set_token` with `environment`, `token`, and `apiUrl` for a new environment.
